                                 TELCOM BILL DATA PROJECT TO FIND INSIGHTS IN IT BY USING PYTHON LANGUAGE

# 1. OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT

# what is meant by TelecomBill Data


* Telecom billing is a process of collecting usage,aggregating it,applying required charges,and finally generating invoices for the customers.Telecom billing process also includes recieving and recording payments from the customers.
* A telecommunication billing system is an enterprise application software designed to support the telecommunication billing process.

# what is meant by circle in telecom bill data?

* The department of Telecommications has divided india into various telecom circles such that within each circle,the call is treated as a local call,while across zones,it becomes a long distance call.
* Telecom circle service areas are merged in inter service area connected.
* The dialing procedure for calls with in a state for these states would also be simplified,i.e. dialing of mobile to mobile subscribers and fixed to mobile subscribers.

# what is meant by Hierarchy_id ?

* The hierarchy id data type is a variable length,system data type.Use hierarchy to represent position in a hierarchy.
* A column of type hierarchyid doesnot automatically represent a tree.Given two hierarchyid values a and b, a<b means a comes before b in a depth_first traversal of tree.
* It is upto the application to generate and assign hierarchyid values in such a way that the desired relationship between rows is reflected in the values.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                           

# what is meant by parent_id ?

* parentid is a system field;it comes standard in salesforce.it's used to relate a feed item to a user record or account record.For example,let's say i want to connect a feed item with an account record,the ID of the account is linked to the parentID.

# what is meant by Account_no ?

* A unique identifier for an account that can be either system-generated or entered manually.

# what is meant by subscriber_no ?

* It is the mapping of the telephone number to the subscriber identity module in a mobile or cellular phone.This abbreviation has several interpretations,the most common one being "Mobile station International Subscriber Directory Number".

# what is meant by DEL_no ?

* DEL stands for Direct Exchange Line.
* An analogue communications circuit or channel provided for the exclusive use of a particular subscriber- also known as private line.

# what is meant by service_active_date ?

# what is meant by bill_sequence_number ?

* Sequence numbers are one of the most important aspects of bill sequencing as they ensure that the income is properly documented for tax and accounting purposes;they also make easier to track payments.

# what is meant by month_yy ?

* The abbreviation mm_yy on a telcom bill data tells us that the two-digit-month and two-digit-year of the service expiration date.If this date has passed, you won't be able to use your service,so make sure service provider will sends you a message that you need to renew  your service.

# what is meant by bill_period ?

* Bill period means the period in which all purchases of goods and/or services,cash advances,fees and charges incurred by service member are recorded by the service provider.
* Billing period means a calender month following the accounting period.

#  what is meant by bill_company ?

* Bill company means any affiliated or unaffiliated company that is hired by a service provider to coordinate the payments and service and to generate service or bill payments from the customers on the telcom service.

# what is meant by ACCOUNT_CATEGORY ?

# what is meant by MKT_SEGMENT ?

* A market segment is a group of people who share one or more common characteristics,lumped together for marketing purposes.Each market segment is unique and marketers use various criteria to create a target market for their product or service.

# what is meant by PRODUCT ?

* A product is a logical or physical entity which can be sold out to an end customer by the operators.This could be a mobile phone,internet connection,voice call connection,vpn,video on demand ,etc.A product can have its monthly rental,which we call periodic charges also.A product can be usage generating product or non-usage generating product.
* so even if, a customer is not using it, he has to pay monthly rental.

# what is meant by DATA_USAGE ?

* when it comes to cell phone plans,data usage is basically the amount of data you see in a billing cycle(usually a month).your cell phone plan's data is used whenever you use your phone's internet connection to perform any task.

* some common ways data is used on smart phones include:

   * Browsing the internet
   * Downloading and running apps
   * checking mail
   * posting on social media 
   * playing games
   * Watching streaing video

# what is meant by DATA_USAGE_UNITS ?

* we measure usage in gigabytes.A gigabyte,or gig is one of the standard units to quantify data transferred between your network and the internet.It is represented by the symbol GB and consists of roughly 1 billion bytes.Like other providers,we calculate your monthly usage based on the number of gigabytes used.
* A gigabyte is 1024 times larger than a megabyte (mb).
* some of the data usage units are following:
   * Download 100000 emails
   * View 200 3-minute videos 
   * watch five 45-minute TV shows

# 5. DOCUMENT YOUR RESULTS

# write down your insights ?

# introduction

* Telecommunications billing is the group of processes of communications service providers that are resposible to collect consumption data, calculate charging and billing information,produce bils to customers,process their payments and manage debt collection.

# Insights:

# Working with data:

*   In this project the given dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables.
*   firstly we have to understand the data and read the data dictionary.
*   Then after import the data into python and do some basic data checks,like rows,columns etc.,
*   we find the variable names.
*   finding the formats of each variable completed.
*   explanation of each variable is completed.
*   finding the missing values is returned.
*   Dividing the dataset into two parts which contains training data=80% and testdata=20%.


# Variable level analysis:

*  For each variable we findout the missing values and outliers by using boxplot method,and if the variable is continuos drawing boxplots for those variables and calculating the percentiles and finding the statistics of each variable is completed.If the variable is categorical data we have created frequency tables for those.
*  we find the missing values in some variables we filled  with mean value in that missing values.

# Data Visualization:

* we have given the basic summary of data.
* for each variable we have plot a graph.
* creating individual graphs and insights for each variabe is returned.
* To give the good visualization for given data we prepared HTML and Sweetviz report for it.
